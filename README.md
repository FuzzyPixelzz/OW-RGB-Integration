Adds RGB effects to supported devices.
(Supports SteelSeries and Razer keyboards/mice)

# Effects
- Health
- Oxygen
- Fuel
- Flashlight (mouse only)
- Ambient effects based on location and loop time

Note: Only ambient effects will show on keyboards without per-key lighting
(Probably, I don't own a non-per-key lighting keyboard so I have to trust I followed the docs correctly)
